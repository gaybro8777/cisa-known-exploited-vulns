# cisa-known-exploited-vulns

>**NEW** A GitHub issue will be created in this repo for every new KEV Catalog release (starting with 2022-06-14) and will look like [this](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/cisa-known-exploited-vulns/issues/1). Each CVE in the release will have some NVD metadata, current (as of the release date) EPSS score, and links to any "in the <https://inthewild.io> entries (if they exist), along with a badge indicating whether the vulnerability is remote, or local/adjacent.

Code with daily GH action to archive CISA's KEV Catalog (https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) and generate a triage issue for each new release.

Each archive is prefixed with an ISO stamp and stored in `docs/` as that dir is published via GH Pages.

[This](https://hrbrmstr.github.io/cisa-known-exploited-vulns/) is an example of a "KEV Report" that will eventually (a) be auto-generated after each scrape, and (b) have expository before each section. File an issue if you'd like more CVE details fields and/or any other views.
